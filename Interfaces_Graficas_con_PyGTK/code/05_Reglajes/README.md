The problem arises when those responsible for a team of Formula One have
to decide under what car setup will give the best results. 
This configuration is different for each circuit where the car has to compete.
During the season each team selects a circuit that does not have to be 
one where you compete during the season, either by proximity to the car 
parts maker or by the climatic conditions of the area. In this circuit 
are obtained based configurations, in which the car gets good results.

These original settings are used as a starting point, when deciding which 
configuration right to compete in a given circuit. 
Depending on the technical characteristics of the circuit will choose 
one of the basic configurations that have team leaders.

The factors that have to decide one or the other settings are:

* Tire Camber

* Height of fins.

* Weight distribution.

* Suspension stiffness.

* Ratio (Marches).

* Vehicle height to the ground.

* Engine speed level.

* Braking distribution.


For each circuit these factors have a greater or lesser influence on the
results that would set the car on the track.


Therefore this problem is considered multi-rate, since we must choose 
the best option depending on more than one criterion, which can be 
resolved through ELECTRE method.
